<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is james musa. Am 19 years old and also an upcoming web developer. This is my project from my lovely online teacher Mrs Angela yu.So to begin with am 6'1ft and also Dark in complextion.
  Am from one of the biggest country in the world and the giant of africa of course am talking about nigeria.
  am from an extended family. my dad and mom had a total of 6 children which include 3 boys and 3 girls. me and my twin brother are the last born
  and also the first born are also twin we where given birth on the same month and day but diffirent year. i know right what
  a coincidence but that's just the truth. i love my family so much even do we don't  get along together that well but family always comes first right.
  me and brother where given birth on 28 decembar 2004. my zoidac sign is capricon and i love playing video games i know for some of you it may seem childish
  but that's actually one of the things that's helps with my mental state so for me it's a way of life lol i know am being childish right now but that's just me okay.
  my dad is from taraba state mean while my mom is from beune state. my dad is jenjen by tribe and  my mom is idoma by tribe . i wonder how those two met and fail in love because
  for me is like mixing salt and sugar to bring out an unknown taste but for some reason those two are madly in love with each other and can never be sepreted.
  but even though they are in love with each other they fight always like hell and some time you just ask yourself are those two really in love with each other but that's there secret weapon of love lol
  i call it the law of 3116 funny right. let't skip the love part for now let me tell you about my siblings . for starters 
  i love them all but they can be so annoying some time .first i Don't know much about the first twin that is betty and bob because the age gap is much to begin with 
  but for some purpose i don't get along with betty that much but is a long story. she have 2 great kids david and success
  i know right funny name to give to a male child according to her she gave him the name because of a successful bussniess with the queen of england
  lol am only kidding okay only she knows where she got that name from. mean while bob also has a child which is dainel the lion king the reason i gave him the name is because he is so stubborn
  and knows how to cry so much but at the same time he is a wonderful kid. i don't know is dad that well but for some good reason i know is a great person and am proud of him.
  we move on to the next 3 Ruth, Patience, and John. Ruth the great mohbad sister and the queen of exaggeration trust me you don't wanna know why i call her those name.
  she is the second born of the family of musa and my fighting partner because we always argue. but at the same time my gisting partner some days
  we don't totally get in agreement while some days we laugh as if nothing has happend between the both of us. some time i wonder if she is a racist because am dark in complextion and she is light
  i don't know but she is family  and family always stick together. she has 2 wonderful children there names are bobo and lovelyne they are the true definition of push and pull, love and hate, yin and yang, black and white etc.
  they love competing with each other and love fighting. lovelyne is the senoior and the ada of the family because she was the first grandchild of the family and a rare diamond.
  she is beautiful and smart and more matured than are age and also the better version of her mom. mean while bobo at the other hand is totally diffirent he is my NBP 
  because i was his nani  when he was growing up and he alomost behaves like me that's why i call him my NBP. i know many of you reading this will be asking what the meaning of NBP my answer to you
  is go and ask your grandfather lol am sorry  for using such abucive words i just saw that on a tiktok video then deicided to write it sorry ones again okay let continue where was i again oh okay bobo my NBP
  he is also smart and one of best dancer i have ever met that't all about ruth family for now. the next part is my favoirte one that's right am talking about the one and only i need drum bells for this one lol just kidding okay 
  let's be serious. the person am about to talk about is an angel sent from heaven she has help and guided me through life she has help me in difficult times and the person who motivated me to start learning web development.
  she is brilliant, smart, intelligent,charismatic, and she sings like an angel from heaven. she has all the quailty of a decent woman she is non other than the great P yeah i know why the name p that's the name i gave her
  but are name is Patience. she is a great person but some time she makes me want to punch her on the face. she is the third born of the family and also the one i am close to because she is just like my mom annoying some time but loving as always 
  sorry i did't mention my mom name from the beginnig her name is alice. like alice in the wonder land. p is not yet married and does not have any children but i know she will make a great mom.
  she is watinig for her prince charmimg to come and rescue her from the dragon city. so if you know you can fight dragon and want to marry a beautiful lady like my sister call my number so we can link up okay.
  i have so much to tell you about p but we need to move on for now. the last but not the list John musa the suviour of the hidden leaf village am talking about the anime king and the tapswap GOD. he is the future of bitcoin and the next micheal jordan.
